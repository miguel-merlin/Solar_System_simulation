# Solar System Simulation
## Overview
The Solar System Simulation is a Python project designed to simulate the motion of celestial bodies within our Solar System. Using the Pygame library, this simulation visually represents the planets orbiting the Sun, offering an educational tool to understand the dynamics of our Solar System.

## Features
- Realistic simulation of the planets' orbits based on their actual orbital speeds.
- Visual representation of the Sun and the eight planets of the Solar System.
- Scalable simulation speed to observe the motion over different time scales.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame

## Setup
To run the Solar System Simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/miguel-merlin/Solar_System_simulation.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory
```
cd Solar_System_simulation
```
3. Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start the simulation, run the main.py script:
```
python main.py
```

## How It Works
The simulation calculates the positions of the planets using Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Each planet is rendered on the screen according to its calculated position relative to the Sun. The simulation can be adjusted to change the speed of the planetary motion, allowing users to observe the orbits over different time scales.
